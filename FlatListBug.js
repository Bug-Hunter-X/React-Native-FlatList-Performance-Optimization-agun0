In React Native, when using FlatList with a large dataset, the performance can become sluggish.  Improper key extraction or using a slow rendering method can cause significant issues.  Additionally, if you are not properly handling component lifecycle methods such as `componentDidUpdate` and `shouldComponentUpdate`, unnecessary re-renders can occur, further impacting performance.  Another potential problem is failing to optimize images, resulting in slow loading times and memory issues. For instance, not using `resizeMode: 'cover'` or not providing optimized images.
